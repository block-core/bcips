## Abstract

Hierarchy for deterministic wallets supporting decentralized identities is based off the `302` as the value for purpose.

This is a list of different identity types under the `302` purpose. Some identities exists under other purposes and those are also included in this BCIP.

## Motivation

Having a known list of identity types that the Blockcore ecosystem supports.

## Body

These are the registered identity types for usage in level 2 of BIP44 described in chapter "Coin type".

All these constants are used as hardened derivation.

| Purpose | Identity (`coin_type'`) | Symbol | Network |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
