## Abstract

Angor - P2P Funding Protocol (P2PFP) is decentralized funding mechanism on the Bitcoin network. It utilizes time-locked contracts whereby investors lock bitcoin into timebased stages. Each stage, upon reaching its time limit, allows the founders to claim the locked bitcoins (and optionally founders may issue in return ownership interest to investors). Alternatively, investors can recover any remaining coins at any time, however recovery may incur penalties. The system distinguishes two types of investors: lead investors and regular investors. lead investors, often early investors, always incur penalties during coin recovery. Regular investors seeking to recover their coins have two options: they can either accept the penalty or, if enough lead investors have already recovered their coins with penalty, they can use the lead investors hashlocks for a penalty-free recovery. This mitigates fraud, and boosts investor confidence by enabling active control over their investments.

## Motivation

In previous blockchain projects, founders had little incentive to protect investors' interests, such as the value of the issued tokens, once the Bitcoin investment was released. Investors often resorted to lawsuits and social pressure to seek restitution. In this approach, our aim is to protect investors from fraud and mismanagement while also aligning the project incentives with those of the investors.

Moreover, it encourages Bitcoin holders to invest and potentially allocate a portion of their Bitcoin holdings out of HODL mode, thus making it safer for their investments to work for them and for the Bitcoin network as a whole by unlocking more funds for investment.

## Design

This proposal defines an investment protocol where funds are committed to a project into stages, each stage has various spending conditions. The spending conditions for project founders use time-locked contracts and founders keys, while those for investors incorporate a pre-signed multisig recovery transactions (also known as revocations), addiotnaly projects may enable a threshold of hashlocks for fast recovery.

The project founders designate individual stages, each with a defined timeline and expected percentage for each stage. Interested investors lock their Bitcoin according to these criteria but also incude mechanisems to recover thier investment.  

The design identifies two types of investors: early investors, termed lead investors as they initiate the investment (lead investors are optional), and subsequent regular investors. Before publishing the investment trasnaction, both lead investors and regular investors generate a multisig penalty transaction, pre-signed and locked in to a long time-lock commitment, in case of lead investors they will also commit to a secret. This transaction grants the investor the ability to recover their investment at anytime by incuring a long timelock penalty.  

If a project has lead investors, regular investors can introduce an additional spending path to their investment transaction. This additional spending path is a threshold of hashlocks, investors commit to the hashes of lead investors. Once a sufficient number of lead invesotrs have initiated their recovery transaction, regular investors can exit the investment without a penalty.  

#### Interactive Pre-signing of the Recovery Transaction  

The protocol mandates that both the founder and investor co-sign the penalty recovery transaction. An investor will not broadcast the investment transaction until they have the founder's signature as part of the recovery transaction. To recover their funds, investors need to publish the recovery transaction (excluding any already spent utxos).

#### Nostr protocol for communication

The protocol uses Nostr to facilitate communication between founder and investor, Nostr supports a growing veratity of decentralized communication methods, and Nostr can be extended to fit any new protocol extensions we may require in the future.    
Project information will be published to the Nostr network, specifically direct communication, project information (and matadata), progress update and notifications.  

The protocol will create Nostr identities for the founder and user from the bitcoin wallet, such identities can be used in other Nostr clients as well.  

## Specification  

We utilize the latest upgrades to the Bitcoin network, namely Taproot and Schnorr. Taproot enables the commitment to multiple execution paths of a Bitcoin output, this allows us to create different conditions on the spending of coins.  

### Project parameteres setup

To setup investment transactions certain parameteres need to be defined in advance to be able to build the tapscript spending conditions.

#### Project initial parameteres:

- **Campaign start date** : this is so the funds in the first stage can be locked until the start date.  
- **Target funding amount** : if target funding was not reached the founder will no be able to spend funds only sign exit transaction (otherwise investors will use the penalty).  
- **Stage funding break down and stage dates** - so investors know how many Bitcoin payment stages (outputs) to create and what are the time locks and amounts in each stage.  
- **Project end date** : to be able to create a condition where investors can take back funds if they are never used.    
- **Founder keys** : the keys of the project founder that will claim the investment when a stage is reached.
- **Founder recovery keys** : the keys of the project founder that will be used for the 2-of-2 recovery multisig.
- **Founder nostr keys** : the keys of the project founder that will be used for the 2-of-2 recovery multisig. 
- **Lead investor window** : the window where seeders can invest 
- **Lead investor min amount** : the minimum amount a lead investor must invest to be considered

#### Investor parameteres: 

- **Investor key** : the key an investor controls to release their coins during recovery (or if the target was not reached).  
- **Lead Investor Secret** : A secret that is used for the lead investor for the threshold hashlocks.

Each investor will then generate a transaction with an output for each stage locked under the conditions agreed upon earlier.

### Key derivation path.   

In order to facilitate the retrieval of coins and recovery keys during active investments, we establish a derivation path that specifies the generation of different keys.

All keys must be hardened derivation following `m / purpose' / coin_type' / project_id' / member_type'`

**Angor Key**                                               - `A well known xpubkey`
**Founder key**                                            - `m / 5' / n'`   
**upi - Unique Project Identifier**                - `Low64(hash256(founderPubKey))`  
**Project Identifier**                                     - `Bech32(ExtPubkey(AngorKey).Derive(upi))`  
**Founder/Investor Nostr Key (NIP06)**      - `m / 44' / 1237' / upi' / 0 / 0`  
**Nostr Storage Key (NIP06)**       - `m / 44' / 1237' / 1' / 0 / 0`  
**Founder Recovery Key**                            - `m / 5' / 0' / upi' / 1'`  
**Investor Lead Secret**                               - `m / 5' / 0' / upi' / 2'`  
**Investor Key**                                            - `m / 5' / 0' / upi' / 3'`  

n = project index created by the founder, a foudner may create a few projects under the same wallet  
upi = an integer extracted from the lower part of the sha256 of the founder key

### Founder initialization transaction

To signal the creation of a project, the founder will publish a transaction on the blockchain.    

#### Project identifier

Every project created in Angor will receive a unique identifier. This identifier is derived from the founder's key and the Angor xpubkey.  

- The project identifier will appear as the first UTXO in both the founder’s initialization transaction and the investor’s investment transaction.  
- It is represented as a regular SegWit address, but with the Bech32 prefix `angor`, allowing external observers to recognize it as an Angor investment identifier.  
    
Example:  
`angor1q2umav7t03jjtrtr4ejmf7ecwnqx76q9tz544wq`

#### Protocol versioning

To implement protocol versioning, we will encode the version number in the satoshis of the Project Identifier output in the initialization transaction.    

Example `0.00010001` to represent verison 1 of the protocol  

#### Storing essential metadata in `OP_RETURN`  

##### The initialization transaction will commit to the following essential project details   
- **Founders public key**
- **Nostr event id** containing the project's metadata

Format:  
```
OP_RETURN
<founder-key> 
<keyType>  
<nostr-eventid> 
```

By storing the Nostr event ID, the founder effectively commits to the project parameters.
Once recorded on the blockchain, the founder cannot alter the metadata without modifying the event ID, ensuring immutability.
Additionally, the metadata in the Nostr event is required for generating Taproot scripts when spending coins.

##### Investor Metadata Commitments    

Investors will also store metadata in their investment transactions.  

- For regular investors, the second output in the investment transaction will contain:  

```
OP_RETURN
<investor-key> 
```

- For lead investors, an additional hash of a secret will be included:  

```
OP_RETURN
<investor-key>
<hash_of_secret>
```

### The taproot spending conditions. 

The spending condition for each stage is represented by the taproot path. To ensure a controlled release of funds as the project advances, different time locks are applied to each stage. This approach allows for a gradual allocation of resources as the project team successfully meets their predetermined goals and objectives.

#### Founder taproot path

The funds are being held in a time-locked script, which can only be spent after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Additionally, the script requires a signature from the founder key, which ensures that only authorized individuals can spend the funds.

```
<founder-key> 
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY  
<stage_time_lock> 
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY 
```

#### Investor taproot path with penalty

The funds are being held in a multi-signature script, which requires signatures from the investor and founder before the funds can be spent.  

**Regular investors**

```
<founder-recovery-key> 
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY   
<investor-key> 
OP_CHECKSIG   
```

**Lead investors**

Lead investor adds the hashlock to the multisig, this forces the lead investor to reveal the secret when recovering in to a penalty.  
The reveal of the secret allows regular investors to use the secret for recovery without penalty, once sufficient lead investors recover in to a penalty.    

```
<founder-recovery-key> 
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY   
<investor-key> 
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY   
OP_HASH256
<hash_of_secret>
OP_EQUAL
```

This is the spending condition that needs to be presigned by the founder in order for the investor to be able to recover with a penalty

The script the founder will sign will look like this

```
<investor-key> 
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 
<penalty_time_lock> 
OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY  
```

The founder will provide the investor with the signatures of the output for each stage in the investment transaction, using SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY to commit to each input separately. This allows each input to be potentially recovered independently by the investors. The investor must keep a backup of such signatures to be able to recover thier funds.  

#### Investor taproot path no penalty (threshold of hashlocks)

To avoid penalty when recovering funds a regular investor will commit to additional taproot leaves in the investment transaction, this is the threshold of hashlocks of the lead investors.  
To achive that we use taproots ability to create many commitment leaves.  

Lets assume there are 5 lead investors and the threshold is 3 hashlocks  

We would then create a branch for each threshould combination  
The formula for combinations is:  

$$
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
$$

Where:
- \( n \) is the total number of lead investors.
- \( k \) is the number of the threshold of lead investors.
- \( ! \) denotes factorial.

So, for example there are 10 combinations of 3 elements out of 5. These combinations are:

    {L1,L2,L3}
    {L1,L2,L4}
    {L1,L2,L5}
    {L1,L3,L4}
    {L1,L3,L5}
    {L1,L4,L5}
    {L2,L3,L4}
    {L2,L3,L5}
    {L2,L4,L5}
    {L3,L4,L5}

An example of 1 taproot branch in the tree would looke similar to the following

```
OP_HASH256
<lead1-hash>
OP_HASH256
<lead2-hash>
OP_HASH256
<lead3-hash>
<investor-key>
OP_CHECKSIG
```

When spending using this option only one of the branches is added to the transaction.  

#### Project expiry date  

Once the project finish expiry has been reached, the investor may claim any remaining coins that were not claimed by the project.  

```
<investor-key> 
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 
<finish_date_time_lock> 
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY  
```

#### Commitments and proofs

A Bitcoin Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) output employs a commitment scheme to obscure its underlying scripts. In order to initiate a spend of the funds held in the output, the spender must possess knowledge of the hash of the commitment's leaves. Consequently, the investor must divulge the script to the spender to facilitate spending.

For the investor this is not an issue as all the parameteres to create the script and generate the hash of the commitment's leaves is known in advance and is made public by the project.

To enable the project founder to access the public key of the investors, an additional `op_return` output is added to the transaction. This output contains the investor's public key (and hash of the secret for lead investors), which the investor can use to generate the hash of the commitment's leaves and claim the coins.  

To distinguish transactions belonging to a particular project, a public common address is defined as a unique project identifier. A small fee is sent to this address, which allows the project to be easily identified and tracked.  

With this information, a transaction contains all the necessary data for project founders to discover it and access the invested coins. By utilizing specialized block explorers, it is possible to track the total investment raised by a particular project.  

### Transaction structure

This is an example of a transaction by one investor each invetor must generate such a transaction 

M(n)  - we assume 5 stages  
FK    - 1 founder key  
FRK   - 1 founder recovery key  
IK    - 1 investor key   
SK(n) - N seeders  
ED    - expiry date
