## Abstract

The extension action capability to `Connect` with dapps should result in the returned key being based upon this specification.

## Motivation

Ensure that a deterministic key is returned with permission to wallet using `Connect` event that follows same patterns and
structure as regular key access.

## Body

Additional deterministic keys can be derived from this root node, usually with the next value being the `coin_type` from SLIP-44.
